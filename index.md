# QuanTrans: Transforming Quantum Circuits to Minimize Communications in Distributed Simulations

## Overview

The code will be open source after the article is published.

## Supplementary Materials

We provide a brief introduction about the basics of quantum circuit simulation. Besides, since the simulation part of our work is mainly based on [QuanPath](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-023-04192-x), we also provide a simple example of QuanPath simulation for a separable circuit. The description can be found [here](https://github.com/bdis-q/quantrans.github.io/blob/main/supplement/QuanTrans-supplement.pdf).
